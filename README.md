# monte_carlo
Approximation of pi using the Monte Carlo method.

The files in this repository make use of the Monte Carlo method to approximate 
pi in various ways. Each file can be described as follows:

pi_monte_carlo_for.m: approximates pi via the Monte Carlo method using a for loop <br />
pi_monte_carlo_while.m: approximates pi via the Monte Carlo method using a while loop <br />
approximation_script_for.m: outputs an .svg plot describing the changes in estimated pi and respective error with increasing number of points <br />
approximation_script_while.m: outputs an .svg plot describing the changes in computational load as tolerance/error between estimated and actual pi decreases <br />
for_loop_movie.m: animates the use of random point sampling for pi estimation as defined by pi_monte_carlo_for <br />

In order for everything to work appropriately, please download all files
into the same folder, which you can then open in the MATLAB workspace. 
From here, any script or method can be called in the command window.
